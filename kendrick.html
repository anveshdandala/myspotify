        Kendrick Lamar's compelling lyricism, virtuosic microphone command, and sharp conceptual vision have translated
        to a rare combination of continuous chart feats and critical acclaim, plus respect and support from the artists
        who paved the way for the rapper's advancement. The Compton MC started as a teen in the early 2000s and hit his
        creative and commercial stride the next decade. The proper albums Lamar released by the end of the 2010s, namely
        the breakthrough good kid, m.A.A.d city (2012), Grammy-winning To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), and Grammy- and
        Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN. (2017), displayed an unmatched mix of inventive wordplay and riveting narratives
        with assertion of artistic dominance, examination of internal conflict, and upliftment of community all
        centered. Remarkably, those qualities were exemplified in their Top 40 singles, including "Swimming Pools
        (Drank)," "i," and the number one hit "HUMBLE." among a total of seven the albums produced. Lamar's
        screenplay-level detail of writing on those recordings was enriched by a shifting collective of producers,
        instrumentalists, singers, and rappers, many of whom -- from inspirations and to peers such as Sounwave, , and
        -- likewise represent Los Angeles. The rapper's cinematic and collaborative inclinations inevitably attracted
        the mainstream film industry, leading to an executive production role on Black Panther: The Album (2018), the
        source of three additional Top 40 singles. Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), fueled by intense
        self-analysis, became Lamar's sixth consecutive chart-topping project despite containing his most challenging
        and confrontational work. A heavily publicized feud with in 2024 yielded several diss tracks, including the
        chart-topping "Not Like Us."

        Compton, California native Kendrick Lamar Duckworth grew up immersed in hip-hop culture and surrounded by gang
        activity. As a youngster, he gradually discovered an aptitude for writing stories, poems, and lyrics, which
        naturally led to rapping. He made a name for himself as K. Dot. At the age of 16 in 2003, he issued his debut
        mixtape, The Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year. While it merely hinted at the potential of the then-teenager,
        it was impressive enough to catch the attention of and led to a long-term association with the label that
        steadily propelled his career. Training Day, the collaboration No Sleep 'til NYC, and C4, issued from 2005
        through 2009, likewise preceded Lamar's decision to go by his first and middle names. The last of the three was
        issued the same year he became part of , a group whose members -- including fellow artists , , and -- frequently
        appeared on one another's mixtapes and albums.

        The first tape credited to Kendrick Lamar was Overly Dedicated, released in September 2010. Also the rapper's
        first commercial release, it reached enough listeners to enter Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. After XXL
        magazine selected him for the 2011 Freshman Class feature, Lamar released his first official album, Section.80,
        that July, and crossed into the Billboard 200, reaching number 113. With deeper conceptual narratives and
        sharpened melodic hooks, as well as comparative multidimensional development from primary producer Sounwave, the
        set acted as a kind of warning flare for Lamar's mainstream rap dominance. In addition to the dozens of tracks
        he had appeared on by then, Lamar had the support of veteran West Coast stars as well. During a concert later in
        2011, , , and dubbed him "The New King of the West Coast," a notion endorsed more significantly by signing Lamar
        to his -affiliated label.</p>
